A simple table selector for the website tablefinder.info. The goal was to allow a small group of users select seats at a table for an event.

Functionality includes:

 * Administratively create accounts with randomized passwords.
 * Select tables, provides an graphical interface for seeing which seats are taken, available, or selected.
 * Email confirmations.

## Demo website

[User login can be found here](http://demo.tablefinder.info)

Username is `adam@test.com` and password is `pOd{Zd5f:&FH`

[Admin login can be found here](http://demo.tablefinder.info/adminlogin.aspx)

Admin username is `Admin` and password is `hello!@#world123`

## To do

To do list, in no particular order

 * Fix the CSS, it's a bit of a mess and the layout could be significantly better.
 * Unit testing, the code doesn't exactly lend itself to testing right now, so more refacting would be in order before beginning this.
 * More administrative functionality such as modifying user information, modifying table selections, password resets.
