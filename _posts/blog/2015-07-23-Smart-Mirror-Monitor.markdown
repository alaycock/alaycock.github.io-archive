After I bought the Raspberry Pi, and the Hover, the next step was to get an
appropriate monitor. The monitor I went with is the
[AOC E2476VWM6](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX54712), which isn't a
great monitor for daily usage since the colour isn't great, and only has HDMI
and VGA ports.

The big selling point of this monitor was it's thickness and weight. I plan on
mounting this on my wall, so I don't want it sticking too far out, nor do I
want it falling because of the weight. Most of the monitor less than 1/4 of an
inch thick, and the thickness at the widest point is just over 1 and 1/4 inches
with the case removed.

Another important factor is that the ports don't stick out, they go down, which
helps further reduce the thickness.

I spent a while researching this monitor, and discussed it with the sales rep
at [Memory Express](http://www.memoryexpress.com/), and came to the conclusion
that I probably wouldn't find another monitor at this thinness and price range.

Removing the monitor case was a breeze, only had to remove two screws and pry
the bezel off which is another reason why this monitor is a great choice.
